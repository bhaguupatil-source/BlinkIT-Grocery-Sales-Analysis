🔍 Key Analyses Performed

📦 Product Category Performance: Identified top-selling categories and compared average sales and ratings.

🛍️ Outlet Type Insights: Analyzed sales trends across different store formats and locations.

🧊 Impact of Item Weight and Visibility: Explored how product features like weight and shelf visibility affect sales.

🗓️ Store Age vs. Revenue: Compared outlet performance based on establishment year.

📈 Tier-wise Sales Performance: Studied how geographic tier (Tier 1/2/3) influences customer purchasing patterns.

🧠 Key Insights

Fruits and Vegetables lead in both revenue and frequency, indicating strong preference for fresh items.

Outlet Size and Type significantly impact sales — medium-sized Supermarkets show the best average sales.

Visibility of items on shelves correlates positively with sales, particularly in high-traffic outlets.

Newer outlets (2020+) tend to perform better in Tier 3 cities due to increased digital adoption post-COVID.

Higher-rated products enjoy 30% more average sales than lower-rated ones.
